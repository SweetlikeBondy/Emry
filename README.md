# About Me
*My personal repository*

I like animals and photography and learning to code
but I'm not very good at photograpy ~~or coding~~ yet!! ðŸ˜…

## Some *mildly* intresting things about me
- I once drove 180 miles (289.7km) with a live tiger in the back of the truck.
- I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in June 2024.
- I've done 2 skydives and 2 SCUBA dives to date.
